# Friend-Finder

This node app askes the user a series of survey questions, and stores them into an array. This array is then compared with the answers of other users to determine the closest possible match.

The application is not deployed to github, and so must be downloaded and run locally to function. Open the directory in command prompt, and run "npm i" to install required node packages. Then, run either "nodemon" or "node server.js" to start the application. Visit localhost:3000 in your browser to view.
